# Automated-Web-Application-Deployment-and-Monitoring

## Introduction

This repository demonstrates a beginner-friendly approach to deploying, automating, monitoring, and scaling a web application using **Linode servers**. It provides hands-on experience with essential DevOps tools and practices, making it an excellent learning project for those new to Linux system administration and automation.

The project includes:
- **Docker**: Containerizing a Python Flask application.
- **Ansible**: Automating server configuration and application deployment.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Monitoring and visualizing system and application metrics.
- **Fluentd**: Centralized logging for easier troubleshooting.
- **OpenLDAP**: Centralized authentication for user and server management.

By following this guide, you'll build a fully automated and monitored infrastructure ready for scaling and debugging.

## Features
- Deploy a simple Python Flask "To-Do List" application.
- Automate infrastructure setup and app deployment using Ansible.
- Monitor server and application health with Prometheus and Grafana.
- Aggregate and centralize logs using Fluentd.
- Configure centralized authentication with OpenLDAP.
- Scale the application across multiple servers using automation.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have:
- A Linode account with access to create virtual machines.
- Basic knowledge of Linux commands and SSH.
- A local machine with **Ansible** installed.
- Optional: Familiarity with Python, Docker, and YAML is helpful but not required.
