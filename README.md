    <h1>Automated Web Application Deployment and Monitoring with Linode</h1>
    
    <p>
        This project demonstrates a complete, beginner-friendly workflow to deploy, automate, monitor, and scale a web application using 
        <strong>Linode servers</strong>. It provides hands-on experience with essential DevOps tools and practices, including:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Docker</strong> for containerizing a Python Flask application.</li>
        <li><strong>Ansible</strong> for automating server configuration and application deployment.</li>
        <li><strong>Prometheus and Grafana</strong> for monitoring and visualizing system and application metrics.</li>
        <li><strong>Fluentd</strong> for centralized logging.</li>
        <li><strong>OpenLDAP</strong> for centralized authentication.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        The guide is structured to help users learn by building a real-world solution step-by-step, covering all major aspects of Linux server management, 
        automation, and troubleshooting. By the end of this project, you'll have a fully automated and monitored web application environment ready for 
        scaling and debugging.
