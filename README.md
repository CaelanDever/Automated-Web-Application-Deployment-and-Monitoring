# Automated-Web-Application-Deployment-and-Monitoring

This project demonstrates a complete, beginner-friendly workflow to deploy, automate, monitor, and scale a web application using Linode servers. It provides hands-on experience with essential DevOps tools and practices, including:

Docker for containerizing a Python Flask application.
Ansible for automating server configuration and application deployment.
Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and visualizing system and application metrics.
Fluentd for centralized logging.
OpenLDAP for centralized authentication.
The guide is structured to help users learn by building a real-world solution step-by-step, covering all major aspects of Linux server management, automation, and troubleshooting. By the end of this project, you'll have a fully automated and monitored web application environment ready for scaling and debugging.
